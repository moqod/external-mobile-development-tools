External Mobile Development Tools
=================================
The purpose of this document is to describe external tools for mobile developers, most of them can be used on any platform (such as iOS, Android, WP). These services reduce development time and make developer's life a bit better.<br />
If you have any idea or would like to suggest a tool - feel free to contact us!

## Dummy Image
URL: http://dummyimage.com/<br />
Dynamic dummy image generator – this service generates images on-the-fly. Sometimes you need a lot of images to test table views or similar stuff, but you haven’t such content – thus DummyImage is what you need.<br />
Image size, text, text color and background color are subject to change – they are incapsulated into URL parameters, read service description for detailed information.<br />
Sample image URL: http://dummyimage.com/400x150/000/fff.png?text=hello,%20world!<br />
Sample image:<br />![Image](http://dummyimage.com/400x150/000/fff.png?text=hello,%20world!)

## Updraft - Continuous Integration
URL: https://getupdraft.com<br />
Updraft is the ultimate app delivery tool created by Moqod. It is intended to help developers compile and distribute builds to customers in no time. Updraft is an example of Cloud CI tailored for mobile projects.<br />
Using Updraft it's easy to create different build configurations - e.g. debug and release based on different targets, Xcode project files or repository branches. So it's not only a beta-testing tool, but also a platform for A/B testing.<br />

##Hurl.it
URL: http://www.hurl.it

A handy tool to test out network requests and see response. Supports most HTTP formats and multiple Authentication protocols.

## Localization
TBD
